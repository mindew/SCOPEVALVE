To run feature_extraction/xdfParse.py, which performs event identification and feature extraction, store the xdf file containing test data in the filepath of feature_extraction/xdfParse.py. Copy the filename of this xdf file into xdfParse.py as the string input of the load_xdf() function at the beginning of the file. You should see the direction "#INPUT THE NAME OF YOUR XDF FILE HERE:" directly above it clearly marking the location in the file. A successful run of feature_extraction/xdfParse.py will result in the creation of testSet0.csv, testSet1.csv, and labelSet.csv in the filepath of xdfParse.py. testSet0.csv contains the extracted features of EMG0, testSet1.csv contains the extracted features of EMG1, and labelSet.csv contains a one-dimensional vector that indicates the event type for each of the events represented in testSet0.csv and testSet1.csv. For more information on the input format of the xdf file and the output format of testSet0.csv, testSet1.csv, and labelSet.csv please refer to our final report.
